class MainMapViewController: UIViewController {
	//TODO: this should have a collection view in it
	//each cell has a background color and (optionally) a transparent png in front of it
	//for example, a tile of red brick would have a dark red background color and a generic "brick pattern" image in front of it
	//this should be a nice way to handle the map, and using background colors will make the images popping in as they load not be too bad
	//obviously you then draw the map objects over this, etc
}
