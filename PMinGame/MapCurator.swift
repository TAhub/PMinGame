		//the map type determines the number of sketchers, their identities, and their values

		//he requires a starting chance to place a wall, and a number of smoothings

		//he has a lewd mind
		//he places rectangles and connects them with lines
		//he requires a min rectangle size, a max rectangle size, a number of rectangles, and a start position
		
		//possibly others in the future?
